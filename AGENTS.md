# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents (any framework) working in this repository.

## Project Context

CareDevi AI Innovation Hackathon 2026 — team project **we-care**.  
Product: **RefAI** — AI-powered referral management portal.  
Hard cutoff: **Sunday April 26, 2026 at 4:00 PM CDT**. No extensions.

## Working Directory

All team code lives under `projects/we-care/`. Do not modify other directories.

```
projects/we-care/
├── README.md            # Required — problem, solution, tech stack, setup, team credits
├── responsible-ai.md    # Required — data sources, model choices, bias, failure cases
├── frontend/            # Vite + React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
├── backend/             # Node.js + TypeScript
└── demo/                # Demo video or screenshots

| Orchestration | Docker                                                               |

## Required Deliverables

All four must exist before the hard cutoff:

1. `projects/we-care/README.md`
2. `projects/we-care/responsible-ai.md`
3. Working demo (live or recorded, 3 minutes max)
4. Meaningful git commit history showing incremental progress

## Scoring Priorities

Optimize design and implementation decisions in this order:

1. **Real-world impact (25%)** — clinical relevance, addresses actual healthcare pain point
2. **UX (15%)** — usable by clinicians or patients, accessible, workflow-appropriate
3. **Technical innovation (15%)** — novel AI/ML use, clean architecture
4. **Presentation (10%)** — working product demo over slides
5. **Feasibility (5%)** — realistic scope, regulatory awareness

## Workflow

For every feature or change:

1. Clarify requirements — ask if unclear before writing code
2. Chunk into tasks
3. For each task: write test → implement → verify → commit → next task
4. Update `responsible-ai.md` when AI features are added or changed

## Coding Practices

- SOLID principles; separate logic from UI components
- Follow test-driven development
- Do not commit `.env` files or secrets

## Commit Guidelines

- Conventional Commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.)
- Micro-commits per logical change, even within one file
- Commit in small code changes if possible small chunk of code from file
- try not to commit multiple files in single commit
- Short subject lines — no filler
- Commit history is scored; commit early and often
- Do not add `Co-Authored-By:` AI attribution to commits
